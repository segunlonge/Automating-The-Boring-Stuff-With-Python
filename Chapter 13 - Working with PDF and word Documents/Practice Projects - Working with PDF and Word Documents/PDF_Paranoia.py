'''
Using the os.walk() function from ChapterÂ 9, write a script that will go
through every PDF in a folder (and its subfolders) and encrypt the PDFs
using a password provided on the command line. Save each encrypted
PDF with an _encrypted.pdf suffix added to the original filename. Before
deleting the original file, have the program attempt to read and decrypt
the file to ensure that it was encrypted correctly.

Then, write a program that finds all encrypted PDFs in a folder (and its
subfolders) and creates a decrypted copy of the PDF using a provided
password. If the password is incorrect, the program should print a message
to the user and continue to the next PDF.
