'''
Say you have a text file of guest names. This guests.txt file has one name per line, as follows:
Prof. Plum
Miss Scarlet
Col. Mustard
Al Sweigart
RoboCop

Write a program that would generate a Word document with custom invitations that look like FigureÂ 13-11.
Since Python-Docx can use only those styles that already exist in the Word document,
you will have to first add these styles to a blank Word file and then open that file with Python-Docx.
There should be one invitation per page in the resulting Word document,
so call add_break() to add a page break after the last paragraph of each invitation.
This way, you will need to open only one Word document to print all of the invitations at once.
