A study by polling forms YouTrend and Cattaneo Zanetto & Co showed that the bloc of Italyâ€™s conservative parties is likely to win a clear majority at the next elections. 
These might come as early as September should PM Draghi fulfill his threat to quit when he addresses parliament tomorrow. 
The polling firms calculated that the rightist bloc, including League Party, Forza Italia and Brothers of Italy would win up to 221 seats out of the 400 in the lower house and 108/200 in the Senate. 
Brothers of Italy currently tops the polls, garnering support of more than 22%. 
This would launch party leader Meloni, or the person she nominates, in pole position to become the new prime minister.
